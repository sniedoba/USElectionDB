# USElectionDB
For this project, we used a web scrapping tool to gather US presidential election data. Together we designed a relational database and Michal then parsed this data into a format that could populate said database.

My major contribution for this project is the code presented in these files. This was my first project where I was solely responsible for full-stack development. Using our Oracle DB and frameworks such as Express.js, Node.js, and Angular.js, I was able to create a web app that allowed us to use a responsive search bar and view presidential election data. 

The Oracle DB used for this project expired after the semester ended. However, you can view a gif showing off the functionality and our final report (which includes screenshots of each screen on page 44) here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v6NXMSRQoFoapB__FaAguc8UnmksIXG_?usp=sharing
